        <div class="problem-col_2">
            <p>ABA sessions typically consist of a variety of activities designed to develop verbal and reasoning skills, and are guided via a trained therapist.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Trained providers are usually either a registered behavior technician (RBT), or a board-certified behavior analyst (BCBA). The provider(s) plans activities (also called "targets"), evaluates client responses (the “behavior” in Applied Behavior Analysis), and delivers intermittent rewards (called "reinforcers").</p>
