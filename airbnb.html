            <br>
            <p>Sharing those memories with the ones we love has taken many travelers to far away apps. Photos once freshly posted decay in a series of long group chats and families who want a secure and safe way to save and share their travel photos have to resort to unwieldy and user hostile solutions to just keep g-ma in the loop.</p>

        <p>After a long 48 hours of non-stop designing, we are humbly proud to have placed 2nd place for the semi-finalist round out of 1500 creative and ambitious entries. We were fairly new to Adobe XD, so having to explore the capabilities of this prototyping software was very insightful to the implementation of our collective vision for Airbnb Journals. We were judged by an Airbnb creative director and experience director through an online livestream.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Moving forward, we would like to validate the user flows and prototype through user testing, and find the most efficient entry points to ensure a cohesive and adoptive user journey.</p>
        <br>
        <p>One of my team mates has also written a case study from his perspective.</p>
